The code shows how to fit a linear regression model to some data and then make predictions. The red line represents the fitted model, and the blue dots are the original data points.

The line is determined by the best parameters (theta) calculated using the normal equation.

This visualization helps in understanding how well the model fits the data and how predictions are made for new feature values.
